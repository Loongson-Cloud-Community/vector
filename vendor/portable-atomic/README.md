Portable atomic types including support for 128-bit atomics, atomic float, etc.

- Provide all atomic integer types (`Atomic{I,U}{8,16,32,64}`) for all targets that can use atomic CAS. (i.e., all targets that can use `std`, and most no-std targets)
- Provide `AtomicI128` and `AtomicU128`.
- Provide `AtomicF32` and `AtomicF64`. (optional)
<!-- - Provide generic `Atomic<T>` type. (optional) -->
- Provide atomic load/store for targets where atomic is not available at all in the standard library. (riscv without A-extension, msp430, avr)
- Provide atomic CAS for targets where atomic CAS is not available in the standard library. (thumbv6m, riscv without A-extension, msp430, avr) (optional, [single-core only](#optional-cfg))

## 128-bit atomics support

Native 128-bit atomic operations are available on x86_64 (Rust 1.59+), aarch64 (Rust 1.59+), powerpc64 (le or pwr8+, nightly only), and s390x (nightly only), otherwise the fallback implementation is used.

On x86_64, when the `outline-atomics` optional feature is not enabled and `cmpxchg16b` target feature is not enabled at compile-time, this uses the fallback implementation. `cmpxchg16b` target feature is enabled by default only on macOS.

See [this list](https://github.com/taiki-e/portable-atomic/issues/10#issuecomment-1159368067) for details.

## Optional features

- **`fallback`** *(enabled by default)*<br>
  Enable fallback implementations.

  Disabling this allows only atomic types for which the platform natively supports atomic operations.

- **`outline-atomics`**<br>
  Enable run-time CPU feature detection.

  This allows maintaining support for older CPUs while using features that are not supported on older CPUs, such as cmpxchg16b (x86_64) and LSE (aarch64).

  Note:
  - Dynamic detection is currently only enabled in Rust 1.61+ for aarch64, in 1.58+ (avx) or nightly (cmpxchg16b) for x86_64, and in nightly for other platforms, otherwise it works the same as the default.
  - If the required target features are enabled at compile-time, the atomic operations are inlined.
  - This is compatible with no-std (as with all features except `std`).

- **`float`**<br>
  Provide `AtomicF{32,64}`.
  Note that most of `fetch_*` operations of atomic floats are implemented using CAS loops, which can be slower than equivalent operations of atomic integers.

<!-- TODO
- **`generic`**<br>
  Provides generic `Atomic<T>` type.
-->

- **`std`**<br>
  Use `std`.

- **`serde`**<br>
  Implement `serde::{Serialize,Deserialize}` for atomic types.

  Note:
  - The MSRV when this feature enables depends on the MSRV of [serde].

## Optional cfg

- **`--cfg portable_atomic_unsafe_assume_single_core`**<br>
  Assume that the target is single-core.
  When this cfg is enabled, this crate provides atomic CAS for targets where atomic CAS is not available in the standard library.

  Note: This cfg is `unsafe`, and enabling this cfg for multi-core systems is **unsound**.

  This is intentionally not an optional feature. (If this is an optional feature, dependencies can implicitly enable the feature, resulting in the use of unsound code without the end-user being aware of it.)

  Enabling this cfg for targets that have atomic CAS will result in a compile error.
